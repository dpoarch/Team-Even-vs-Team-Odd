# Team-Even-vs-Team-Odd

This application creates 2 teams for a 3-on-3 basketball tournament from the following endpoint:
https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users

The teams consist of 3 players on each team from the list of 10 users from the endpoint.

This solution uses C#/.NET to fetch only the first 6 users from the endpoint and returns only their name, email address, city, and company
name for the tournament.

All 3 of the even numbered results are assigned to the Even Team and all 3 of the odd results are assigned to the Odd Team.
